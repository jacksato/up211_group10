Group 10 Project Update
=================

**Project title**: Spatial Exploration of Eviction in LA County

**Group Name**: Eviction Resisters

## Roles

Give each team member a title, and define what role each team member will play, and how each person plans to contribute to the project. While this may be subject to change, it is a good idea to define this early in the project to clarify "who is doing what."

#### Jack:
-Project lead/submitting and reviewing 

-Comparing demographic/sociological data in one county in LA with low eviction rates

-Variables to compare: Rent as a percentage of income; Employment status; Household size; Median income; Education Level; Race

#### Kristal:
-Define overview of issue/topic of eviction

-Analysis of homeownership data in LA County (renters are our community of focus-seeing where they are in comparison to LA overall and owners)

-Temporal analysis to see whether renter population is decreasing/increasing over time

#### Daisy: 
-Analysis of Eviction notices

California consistently has the lowest eviction rates of the 10 most populous states in the country, with 2.2% pre-COVID eviction filings per 100 rental households as compared to 9 per 100 in New York and 16 per 100 in Michigan. Researchers have observed that an increase in eviction filings is associated with a slight increase in the number of homeless people living in shelters. Analysis of the statewide moratorium which was lifted in summer 2023 show that California's most populous counties have been experiencing a rise in eviction filings higher than pre-pandemic averages. The recent wave of eviction filings can be attributed to several factors including moratoria expiring, high inflation rates, end of pandemic aid programs such as food assistance, relaxed eligibility to Medi-Cal, and stimulus checks. The Los Angeles Housing Department received 77 049 eviction notices between February and December 2023. According to the controller's office, 96% of those eviction filings were for non-payment of rent, 91% came with a 3-day notice and represented about $186.5 million accumulated rent owed (lacity, 2024). According to 2019 data, 54% of L.A. County residents were renters, and over half of those renters were rent burdened. Further, 29% of all households were considered "severely rent burdened," paying more than half of their income towards rent and utilities (lacity, 2024).

The top three zip codes in which eviction filings were received were 90028 Hollywood with 5156 notices, 90036 Fairfax with 3840 notices, and 91367 Woodland Hills with 2954 notices. The zip codes with least eviction numbers submitted include zip code 91214 La Crescenta, 90302 Inglewood, with a count of 1 each, 91504 Burbank, 90717 Lomita with a count of 2 each, 90073 Los Angeles count of 3, 90402 Santa Monica, 90067 Century City with a count of 5 each (lacity, 2024).

## Status update 
- Mood is overwhelmed
- Consistent communication, weekly meetings are working

## Data update
The goal is to merge data from different data sources that is applicable to the project. We are still working on merging the data and variables that are crucial to analyzing our case study of Los Angeles county. We have decided to include data focusing on micro scale level so we can compare variables across neighborhoods. Also, we are working on data wrangling and geo-coding to ensure we are working with clean/complete datasets.

## Concerns
### Major concerns:
-Integrating/combining the data

-Finding recent and relevant data (2018-2023)

-Keeping our scope feasible

-finding something to focus on, needing more direction

-Conceptualizing data analysis ideas to coding/Python

-Time constraints

### Minor concerns:
-Working with Python

-turning ideas into tangible data analysis

-understanding libraries

-understanding language/errors (specifically with pushing to GitHub)

-Ensuring an even workload
