Group 10 Project Update
=================

**Project title**: Spatial Exploration of Eviction in LA County

**Group Name**: Eviction Resisters

## Roles

### Part 1: Overall spatial analysis of LA County

#### Kristal
Define overview of issue/topic of eviction. Analysis of homeownership data in LA County (renters are our community of focus-seeing where they are in comparison to LA overall and owners. Temporal analysis to see whether renter population is decreasing/increasing over time.

#### Daisy
Data analysis of eviction notices


### Part 2: Comparing LA County 
  
#### Roberto
Data analysis of census tract with high eviction rates. Variables to compare: Rent as a percentage of income; Employment status; Household size; Median income; Education Level; Race, etc. 

#### Jack
Data analysis of census tract with low eviction rates. Variables to compare: Rent as a percentage of income; Employment status; Household size; Median income; Education Level; Race, etc.

## Status update 
- Mood is overwhelmed
- Consistent communication, weekly meetings are working

## Data update
The goal is to merge data from different data sources that is applicable to the project. We are still working on merging the data and variables that are crucial to analyzing our case study of Los Angeles county. We have decided to include data focusing on micro scale level so we can compare variables across neighborhoods. Also, we are working on data wrangling and geo-coding to ensure we are working with clean/complete datasets.

## Concerns

### Major concerns:

- Integrating/combining the data
- Finding recent and relevant data (2018-2023)
- Keeping our scope feasible
- finding something to focus on, needing more direction
- Conceptualizing data analysis ideas to coding/Python
- Time constraints

### Minor concerns:
- Working with Python
- turning ideas into tangible data analysis
- understanding libraries
- understanding language/errors (specifically with pushing to GitHub)
- Ensuring an even workload
