# Eviction in LA County 

## Research Question
We plan to carry an analysis of the City of Los Angeles eviction rates over time and across neighborhoods so we can understand some of the crucial temporospatial patterns of evictions across different demographics. An analysis of temporal and spatial variation in eviction rates we try to answer the question: How do eviction rates vary across temporal periods within Los Angeles County? What spatial patterns emerge from these eviction rates and how they changed over time for instance a look from 2010 to 2018 period, the pandemic period, and post pandemic period? How have eviction rates changed for specific demographic groups and communities (White, Hispanic, Black, Asian)? How do eviction trends intersect with prevailing understandings of racism, classism, and other forms of inequality? By addressing these research questions, we hope to contribute insights into the temporospatial dynamics of eviction.
 
## Background:
Our research show that recent eviction data from Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) recorded 71 429 eviction notices from February 2023- November 2023, 5 902 notices were filed for the month of November only, 96% of eviction notices were for “non -payment of rent”, 91% came with a 3-day notice, and $3760 was the average amount of rent that was owed by tenants (lacity, 2024). Researchers highlight that individual and neighborhood level sociodemographic factors correlate with eviction, and the uneven distribution of socioeconomic characteristics and housing conditions across neighborhoods likely produces patterns of spatial clustering in eviction (Nelson et al, 2021).

People have long classified the constellation of phenomena that drive eviction rates, displace communities, and contribute to homelessness as gentrification. As we develop deeper understandings of this issue, it is becoming clear that the causative factors and impacts of gentrification are driven by the structures and histories of racial capital. Disproportionate impacts on Black and Brown communities, lasting impacts of racial segregation, and differential access to real estate capital are but a small subset of consequences pointing to this connection. Rising eviction rates represents an important area of study as a potential impact of gentrification and a driver of increasing homelessness. By exploring geospatial data related to eviction, we hope to elucidate some of these relationships in order to better understand how eviction works and what might be its role in gentrification.

## Spatial Scope:
Our research dives deep into the neighborhoods of Los Angeles County, going beyond just the city. We want to understand how eviction challenges differ in various communities across this vast county. We recognize that different neighborhoods and regions may experience unique challenges related to eviction, and our spatial analysis seeks to address this nuance. The choice of Los Angeles County as our primary focus is intentional and allows us to examine the socioeconomic, cultural, and geographic diversity, presenting an ideal landscape for understanding the factors contributing to eviction rates. 

We also plan to look at a 10-year period—while specifically looking at the changes before and after COVID-19. This timeframe is important for understanding how eviction risks change over time, especially with the rise of unaffordable housing and pauses on rent during the pandemic.

## Conclusion
Our research, focused on eviction in Los Angeles County, aims to reveal insights into recent eviction trends over the last 10 years. By exploring spatial and temporal dimensions, we seek to conduct a risk assessment of vulnerable populations and regions, track trends from pre-pandemic to post-pandemic periods, and uncover correlations between eviction rates, gentrification, racialized policies, and social inequalities. Our approach integrates geospatial analysis and demographic insights with a goal of identifying intervention opportunities. We aim to research policy analysis regarding housing displacement through eviction data. After completing our analysis we hope to suggest new interventions where policies can better focus on equitable housing developments. Through our comprehensive spatial data analysis and demographic variables that we will analyze we hope to uncover impactful conclusions to evictions across Los Angeles County.
